PART-1: WHAT and HOW
<hr>
This project showcases my journey, skills, and accomplishments as a NEXTGen student specializing in Artificial Intelligence.

Topics I have covered:

Introduction           :        A brief overview of my background and aspirations.
Experience             :        Details of my certifications, education, and goals.
Projects & Services    :        Currently, this is my first project I consider to showcase, which covers my knowledge in fundamental areas.
Contact Links          :        Direct connections to my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles via buttons and QR codes.
Technologies Used      :        HTML, CSS for design and layout    and
                                   Command Prompt as Administrator for QR codes and hard work for certificates
CHAT GPT REFERENCE     :        I had created another project prior to this with very basic CSS. I tried to compare that with ChatGPT, underestimating 
                                it, and gave the prompt, "make this website better." The result I got after that prompt opened my eyes. I witnessed 
                                many properties that I had never used before. I started experimenting with them, and for other properties that were 
                                complicated to understand, I kept their screenshots and noted them down as WhatsApp messages to myself (so I could later 
                                discuss them with my professor).

PART-2: PROBLEMS WHILE WORKING
<hr>


To start with, 
I had a problem with creating a vertical line to separate my certificates in the past experiences section. That experience was really frustrating because I had the misconception that if a line needs to be drawn, it should only be drawn with the  hr  tag. I wasted so much time trying to make hr  vertical. I later found out that we could use a simple  div <div> tag with CSS and make its background color our vertical  hr 

Next, centering the div <div>, 
Again, in the past experiences section, I have used two of my certificates with different heights and widths if observed precisely. Firstly, I aligned them to the center and was successful. However, when it came to centering the certificates' description, I had a hard time doing it. I was trying to make them center with margin and padding. Then I shifted to justify-content and align-items properties, but they were not willing to center themselves. I wanted to use one property and not overwrite it, keeping my code clean, but both methods were not helpful. In the end, I had to use position: relative and then align it with the left property. These options were there from the start; however, I feel like if nothing seems to work, only then should I use them.

Most of the time, my work was very easy, and I came near the end— the footer of my website. And there was the last problem waiting for me: my footer sub-heading, which needed to be colored grey and, at the same time, its properties needed to be altered. At that time, I was using my early-defined CSS color property, which was grey in color. So, I used that class with my paragraph element. Then, when it came to giving other properties, I got blanked because I was still learning. I then tried to use two class attributes in the element (paragraph in my case). When I tried, the one which was written last was the only one applied to the element. I still have many questions about such experiments of mine, which I will discuss with my professor soon, so I cannot make definitive statements now. The problem was then resolved with simply adding parent element and giving it the color property. 

This was my journey in this project.
I really appreciate your being with me until now and sharing in my experiences.

<h2>EDIT---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------> DATE: 1/27/2025</h2>
I realized the day after I completed my portfolio (old one), I thought one day and a half night is all it takes to create a static website. But I was unaware of responsive website design. The second I minimized my tab where my localhost website was running (port-80), it shrank horribly. I was in complete shock from this new discovery. For me, someone who had been in the "stone age" of web design, I never expected that.<br><br>

Later, I found out about it and started my MISSION: Responsiveness journey. I faced so many difficulties on this new journey. If I were to say it, it might take days to express every challenge, but overall, GRID layout and MEDIA QUERIES were my most difficult phases to understand. But now, they seem like nothing.<br><br>

Another thing is that I really, really had a hard time dealing with clamp() font-size properties for my different dimensions. To be honest, it was tough, but now I'm getting the hang of it.<br><br>

The rest wasn't so hard, in my opinion. Now, I am confident enough in my CSS skills and I also understand the importance of projects. I'm really getting the concepts learned out of my bucket.
